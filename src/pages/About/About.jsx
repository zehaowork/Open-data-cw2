    We are a company that has a mission to help bridge the gap between the people that want to help the society and the opportunities to help the world we live in. The amount of donation has increased by Â£800 from last year. During this COVID pandemic, when the NHS requested for 250,000 volunteers to help them, 750,000 people signed up to volunteer in 24 hours. This shows that humanity exists and together we can help our community, country and the whole world to become a better place to live.
